:computer: I enjoy learning new things, and improving my skills.

My repositories are a mix of PHP :elephant:, Go :hamster:, Rust :crab:, and Java :coffee:.

:raising_hand: I love open source and helping people, just send me a message if you think I can help.

:wrench: I love to automate boring parts of my jobs, so you will probably find a bunch of cli apps, and some bash scripts [here](https://gist.github.com/kunicmarko20).

:raised_hands: I almost always have an opinion about code design/architecture/naming because I really care about writing good code, and making the job easier for the next person.

:blue_book: If you need a tech book recommendation, I can help with that.
